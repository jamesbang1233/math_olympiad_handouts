\section*{Instructions}
\begin{itemize}
\item This problem set is based off the notes ``\textit{Inequalities}". 
\item They are in roughly difficulty order and get quite difficult, so you \textbf{not} expected to be able to solve every problem. 
\item However, please attempt as many questions as you can and submit your solutions to your mentor for marking and feedback.
\item You may type your solutions or take a \textbf{clear} scan/photo of \textbf{legible} written solutions.
\item Feel free to discuss these problems with your peers and on the forum but the solutions you submit must be written by yourself.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For all real $x$, show that $\displaystyle \frac{x^2+2}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}\geqslant 2.$
	\item Prove that for all real numbers $x$, we have $x^4+6x^2+1\geqslant 4x(x^2+1)$. When does inequality hold?
	\item Prove that for all positive reals $a,b,c$, we have $\displaystyle \frac{a^2}{b}+\frac{b^2}{c}+\frac{c^2}{a}\geqslant a+b+c$.
	\item What is the maximum value of $a^5(1-a)$ for $0<a<1$?
	\item Let $x,y$ be nonnegative reals with sum $2$. Prove that $x^2y^2(x^2+y^2)\leqslant 2$.
\end{enumerate}
